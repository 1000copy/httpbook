# Foreword

Today, more and more software is built on HTTP protocols. And I feel its value bit by bit in my several software project.So I think that it will help improve software development efficiency if I  master it fully and systematic. At the beginning of this year, I've dicided to research it fully. I bought a set of books, put them in my car, my office and my home. I'v been trying to made anything about HTTP clear,whether it is useful or not in my work currently,and if any text is not clear enough to understand ,I will digging into source code of Nodejs's HTTP module or ask in `Stackoverflow.com`.The more I study it, the clearer my architecture of HTTP is.

One day, I heard a voice saying to myself, "it must be a interesting thing to  write something about it",because:

1. It used by a lot of people
2. Existing text is too complicated to understand

HTTP prototols was originly very simple, but if you follow the strict text of the RFC,it will seem to be very diffcult. So, I can write a book with Best-First princle.

In the first chapter to I would introduce the HTTP architecture through the sample code. In the following chapters, I will break down the HTTP protocols into small part,including request and response processes. Against something are particularly difficult, there would be a few command lines and a small piece of Node.js source code. So, this is an HTTP book, written by a programmer,and written for programmers. I hope this book looks straightforward enough to help you save a lot of time for study it.

Now it is in front of you.
