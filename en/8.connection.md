# Connnection

HTTP is an application layer protocol based on TCP/IP. The HTTP connection is actually a TCP connection, from start to finish. However, the actual data packet is not an arbitrary binary, but a packet specified by HTTP; the data is not sent arbitrarily, but a request for a response (a request and a response is a transaction).

We care about connectivity because it is about performance in a multi-transaction situation. In HTTP, there are four methods for handling multi-transaction connections:

1. parallel connections
2. Keep-Alive
3. persistent connections
4. and pipelines.

We take a simple file as a multi-transaction case:

    <html>
    <body>
      <h1>image/<h1>
      <img src="2.png"/>
      <img src="3.png"/>
    </body>
    </html>  

Even with such a simple scenes, three transactions are required to fully capture the resources and present them to the client. Used to get `1.html`, `2.png`, `3.png` files respectively. Repeat the process of "opening the connection, sending the client request, the server sending a response, closing the connection" three times. Of course, the latter two request pictures of the transaction is dependent on the first transaction, because only the first transaction is completed, after parsing the HTML, our browser knows that there are still two pictures to be obtained. Let's see how different transaction models should respond to this group request.

## Parallel Connections

In the HTTP/0.9, a connection is a transaction and can only be a transaction. If we visit the following `1.html`,Then the client will send one request to the server.It is a complete process that includes 4 steps, including "open connection, send request, get response, close",First get `1.html`:

    GET /1.HTML

Then the client send another request for getting `2.png` file. Still a process of "open connection, send request, get response, close"

    GET /2.png

Then get `3.png` file. Still a process of "open connection, send request, get response, close"

    GET /3.png


A transaction is a connection, so multiple transactions are multiple connections. This practice, not only HTTP/0.9 can do so, HTTP/1.1 can also do it.

Of course, here is the simplest situation. Because as a limited computing resource, connections can't grow indefinitely.Now what we care about is that all three resources are on the same server, the requests are also from a client, so is it possible to reuse the existing open connections,thus saving the overhead of opening and closing the connection? 

Yes,sure.The next two connection models are for this optimization purpose.


## Keep-Alive Connection

The method of keep-alive connection is that if the client says that it wants to keep the connection and the server also wants to keep it , then both parties (client and server) do not close the connection immediately after completing a transaction, but keep it open for use in subsequent transactions.

The HTTP protocol introduces the header field of the `Connection: keep-alive` so that both parties can express the intent to keep the connection open. In this way, the above three transactions become three steps:

Open connection, send request, get response, but not close:

    GET /1.HTML 
    Connection:keep-alive

And respond:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Connection:keep-alive

    content...

Then get 2.png.Also these three steps of "Open connection, send request, get response, but not close":


    GET /2.png
    Connection:keep-alive

    ---------
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Connection:keep-alive

    content...

Then get 3.png.Also these three steps of "Open connection, send request, get response, and close":

    GET /3.png
    ---------

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

    content...

The last transaction, not sending head field of `Connection:keep-alive`, so it will be closed after the transaction. The effect of this is that the next two transactions can reuse the connection established by the first transaction, saving the overhead of opening and closing the connection twice. This practice is an improvement based on HTTP/1.0. So it is called HTTP/1.0+Keep-Alive.

##  Persistent Connections

Persistent connections are improvements to Keep-Alive. The difference is the difference in default values. The persistent connection tells the connection to close by the header field value of `Connection:close`, and it remains open if it is not sent. Continuous connections are maintained by default, while `Keep-Alive` is turned off by default. This is the difference between the two. Look at the same case, the different performance under persistent connections.

Open connection, send request, get response, and not close:


    GET /1.HTML 
    ---------

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

    content...

Get 2.png。Open connection, send request, get response, and not close:


    GET /2.png

    ---------
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

    content...


Get 3.png。Open connection, send request, get response, and close:

    GET /3.png
    Connection:close
    ---------

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Connection:close
    content...

In terms of reusing connections, persistent connections are consistent with Keep-alive. But with a persistent connection, you can send the Connection header field less than twice.

## Pipeline

The pipeline is yet another optimization based on a persistent connection. The transaction within the persistent connection is still on a step-by-step, that is, the client initiate a request, then wait for a response, and then send a new request after the last response is received. The practice of the pipeline is different. Under this model, the client can issue all the requests at once, and then receive the corresponding responses one by one in the order in which their request are sent. Still look at the case:

Get 1.html。Open connection, send request, get response, and not close:


    GET /1.HTML 
    ---------

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

    content...

Now get 2.png and 3.png。There will be a difference at this time. The browser will issue two GET requests at the same time, and the server will send two responses back in the order of the request. In this way, the transactions appear to overlap.


    GET /2.png

    GET /3.png
    Connection:close
    ---------
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

    ...

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Connection:close

    content...

This is the difference between pipeline mode and persistent connections. This can reduce network time under high latency network conditions.

Well, this is the difference between the four connection models that handle multiple transactions.

## Hands-on

Using a command combination of telnet and echo, send two requests to the server at the same time to see if the server is valid to return a response:

    cd code 
    node pipeline.js

Then execute the command:

    $(echo -en "GET /1 HTTP/1.1\n\nGET /2 HTTP/1.1\n\n"; sleep 10) | nc localhost 3000
