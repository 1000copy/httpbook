## Status Code of 100

When the client sends a require message which header has `Expect:100-Continue` field, the  status code of `100 Continue` informs the client that it can continue to send requests,or not allowed with `417 Expectation Failed`.

The purpose of this is in the case of transfing a big file to server.The client first ask the server if it may receive a large file by `Expect:100-Continue` field,if the server respond the  status code of `100 Continue` then  the client can continue to send requests.

If there is no such status code, the server can only extract the content size from the request header, and then find that the entity content may have been delivered at this time when the conditions are not met. This is another resource waste.

### Case

In this case, the client tried to post an MP3 video to the server. The file size is 101MB. The client does not send this file in the request body, but instead adds a request header item of `Expect: 100-continue` header. If the server can accept files of this size, it returns `100 continue`, otherwise it returns `417 status code`.

1. Simple server with Node.js

    var http = require("http");
    function onRequest(request, response) {
        response.end("hello world\n")
    }
    http.createServer(onRequest).listen(8181);

2. Use Netcat as the client, paste the request HTTP header directly in the console, and press `Enter` twice to send the request to the server:

    $ nc localhost 8181
    POST /content/videos HTTP/1.1
    Host: media.example.org
    Content-Type: video/mp4
    Content-Length: 105910000
    Authorization: Basic bWFkZTp5b3VfbG9vaw==
    Expect: 100-continue

    HTTP/1.1 100 Continue

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Mon, 23 Nov 2015 06:27:53 GMT
    Connection: keep-alive
    Transfer-Encoding: chunked

    c
    Hello world

    0

The HTTP server of node.js accepts files of any size by default, so when it finds `Expect: 100-continue` in header fields, it returns `HTTP/1.1 100 Continue` and returns a response to the request itself. Here is a string of `Hello world`.

The method that wants to override the default behavior, depending on the condition (compared to the specific file size) to decide whether to accept, you can refer to the [node.js manual](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html###http_event_continue)
